An example of this might be: if you want to find the nearest thing to you, you can compare the distances squared instead of taking the sqrt of each, since distance*distance > distance. Or you might be able to run a pre-process step which calculates the distance pairs of everything in advance. (Obviously I'm imagining some sort of 2-D or 3-D data structure). â€“ stusmith Apr 14 '10 at 13:40
